Note: skill-developer uses FLAT structure (no resources/ subdirectory)

## Structure Choice

✅ CORRECT: Using resources/ subdirectory
- Matches backend-dev-guidelines/ pattern
- Matches frontend-dev-guidelines/ pattern
- Aligns with modern Claude Code skill structure
- Better organization for 7 resource files

❌ INCORRECT: Flat structure like skill-developer
- Old pattern (skill-developer was earlier version)
- Less organized for many files
- Doesn't follow current best practice

## Verification

✅ SKILL.md in root
✅ resources/ subdirectory exists
✅ All resource files in resources/
✅ Links updated to resources/ prefix
✅ Cross-references work within resources/
✅ README.md for directory overview
✅ Follows 500-line rule for all files
✅ Progressive disclosure pattern

STRUCTURE: VERIFIED ✅
